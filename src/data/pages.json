{"about":{"title":"about","body":"<h1>About</h1>\n<p>I'm Alice - I'm a (mostly) frontend engineer with a wide range of\ninterests in software things. I like cryptography, functional programming,\nfiddling with JS frameworks, Linux, tiling window managers, vim, and other\nnerdy stuff :).</p>\n<p>I built this site to replace a Jekyll blog, because I wanted to build\na React based single-page app (mostly for fun) which would replicate all\nof the functionality of Jekyll.</p>\n<p>Blog posts and some of the pages are written in Markdown, with a series of\nbuild scripts to turn a directory of Markdown files into JSON, which is\nincluded in the ReactJS app via webpack. I'm using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/alansouzati/react-router-to-array\">react-router-to-array</a>\nand node.js to write static files for a sort of pseudo-isomorphic server\nside routing. These static files are then deployed to <code>gh-pages</code>.</p>\n<p>The app itself is ReactJS, redux, react-router, and some functional libs\n(like Ramda and Sanctuary). The layout and styling for the site is built\nfrom the ground up with just plain SCSS.</p>\n<p>The app is also serving as a kind of monorepo - I have a couple projects\nwhich live in the same repository, and have written build steps to publish\nthem on the site.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to check out the code look\n<a href=\"https://github.com/aliceriot/site\">here</a>.</p>\n","date":"empty date"}}
