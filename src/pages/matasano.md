# Matasano Exercises

These are my solutions to the CryptoPals series of cryptography problems.
You can find the orignal problems [here](http://cryptopals.com/).

I'm solving them here in Golang. I wrote a [Ruby
gem](https://github.com/aliceriot/mark_set_go) to take a Go file and
transform it into valid Markdown, with all the source code formatted as
code blocks and all of the comment text as the body of the Markdown file.
This let's me write an explanation of the solution, using Markdown syntax,
in comments in my source file, and then reformat the source code file into
something suitable for display on the web.

Probably I've made some errors here, if you notice any let me know!

Happy crypto-ing!
