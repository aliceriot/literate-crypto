[Matasano exercise 3](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/3/). This asks
us to break a single byte XOR. Basically, this means that we have a
ciphertext which has been XORed against a single byte. This means we
can exhaustively try every byte until we get it.

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
)
```


First off, something we're almost certainly going to need is a function
that takes a byte slice and a byte, and XORs the contents of that byte slice
with that byte.

We'll call it `arrayXOR`:

```go
func arrayXOR(inBytes []byte, n byte) (outBytes []byte) {
	outBytes = make([]byte, len(inBytes))
	for i, v := range inBytes {
		outBytes[i] = v ^ n
	}
	return outBytes
}
```


Then if we want to XOR a particular byte, say, 42, with a byte array we can
just do `xorResult := arrayXOR(myBytes, byte(42))`. Nice!

Next we'll need a function that takes a string and returns a count
of the occurences of each letter.
We can use a byte -> int map to keep track.

```go
func charCount(bytes []byte) map[byte]int {
	counts := make(map[byte]int)
	for _, c := range bytes {
		_, test := counts[c]
		if test {
			counts[c]++
		} else {
			counts[c] = 1
		}
	}
	return counts
}
```

 ## Doing the work

 now that we've written all of the functions we'll need, we can go ahead
 and solve the problem!

 First, declare the ciphertext


```go
func main() {
	const cipherText = "1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736"
	cipherBytes, _ := hex.DecodeString(cipherText)
	charCount(cipherBytes)
	fmt.Println(charCount(cipherBytes))
	fmt.Println(arrayXOR(cipherBytes, byte(42)))
}
```
