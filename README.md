#Literate Crypto

This is a web project I started to document my progress in learning Go by
doing the Matasano crypto problemset.

There's a quick Ruby script (`script/go_to_markdown.rb`) to convert a Go
source file to Markdown (comments become markdown source, source code
becomes code blocks) and a Rakefile to automate building markdown files
from the Go source.
