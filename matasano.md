After taking an [initial stab](https://github.com/aliceriot/CryptoPals) at
solving the matasano challenges in C, Python, and Ruby, but being unable
to follow through and finish them, I decided to make [another
attempt](https://github.com/aliceriot/CryptoPals). This is a literate
programming document describing my solutions, in Go, to the problems.
I hope you enjoy reading them! I had a lot of fun working through them.
